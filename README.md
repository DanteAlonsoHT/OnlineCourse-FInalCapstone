# Online Course (Computer Vision) Website

> This project is the final capstone for the first module (HTML - CSS).

The next website is about a Master Bootcamp about Computer Vision, it's just an instance according to the website to sell a software course.
For this project, I've used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to the entire website, also I've included GRID and flexbox to make more professional distribution of elements inside specific parts of the website.

## Desktop 💻
<img src="img/DesktopLayout.PNG" alt="DesktopLayout" width="100%">

## Mobile 📱
<img src="img/MobileLayout.PNG" alt="DesktopLayout" width="50%">

I've used 1 breakpoint only, for this reason, the website is responsive for mobile and desktop layouts.
